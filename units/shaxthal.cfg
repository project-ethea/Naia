    _ "Of the many monstrosities comprising the Chaos legions, the most fearsome of them easily are these alien war-beasts known as the ‘Shaxthals’, always present among the front lines when the Overlords choose not to take any prisoners. Their unnatural strength and durable exoskeletons are completely unrivaled by any living creature native to Irdya, and their ability to decimate enemy armies and topple constructions with relative ease makes them an ideal companion for the demon hordes. Those few fools who attempt to fight them head-on almost never survive to tell the tale, as they either get their skulls shattered by a red energy blast originating from the creatures’ maws, or are ripped to shreds in an instant by their teeth and claws."

#ifdef CAMPAIGN_AFTER_THE_STORM
    description= _ "Long before the arrival of humans, an advanced people called the Argazar created a new lifeform combining characteristics from all other creatures known to them. These creatures known as the ‘invincibles’ or ‘Shaxthals’ were originally meant to become the basis for their research into attaining immortality. However, the enemy nation of Rythé forced the Argazar to repurpose their creations for warfare, thus attracting the attention of a mysterious and powerful foe.

Following a devastating strike that poisoned the air and almost completely wiped out their civilization, the remnants of the Argazar found themselves forced to flee to a primitive world “beyond the veil” called Irdya. As life on the surface proved impossible, the Argazar attempted to rebuild their civilization underground. However, the few Shaxthal creatures they brought with them unexpectedly manifested minds of their own and rebelled against their creators. In the process, they began to assimilate the survivors and spawn new generations with new and more sophisticated bodies.

With barely a few dozen Argazars left, they finally found a way to thwart the Shaxthals’ reproductive capabilities, kill the majority of the creatures, and put a few specimens into hibernation for further research. As the last of their people perished, their historians’ hope was that some day a new civilization would emerge and bring the Argazar back to life using the knowledge they recorded into their many crystal glyphs.

Unbeknownst to them, the first race to discover their legacy would have no intention of using any of their findings for good."+"
